# Empowering Active Learning for 3D Molecular Graphs with Geometric Graph Isomorphism

This repository contains the PyTorch implementation of the paper "**[Empowering Active Learning for 3D Molecular Graphs with Geometric Graph Isomorphism](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=He2GCHeRML)**", R.Subedi\*, L.Wei\*, **W.Gao\***, S.Chakraborty, Y.Liu. NeurIPS, 2024.

In this paper, we present a principled Active Learning (AL) paradigm for 3D molecular learning. We propose a set of new 3D graph isometries for obtaining geometric representations of 3D molecular graphs. We formulate a criterion based on uncertainty (using the Bayesian Geometric Graph Neural Network (BGNN)) and diversity (using our proposed method for representing 3D geometric graphs), and pose active sampling as a Quadratic Programming (QP) problem. Experiments on the 3D molecular datasets(QM9 and MD17) demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to the baselines.

# Running Experiments
<ul>
    <li> Prepare data in .pt format in [train, valid, test] order.
    <li>Use Linux Environment to run experiments</li>
    <li>Use conda for package management</li>
    <li>Update parameters in <b><i>run.sh</b></i> file as necessary</li>
    <li> Best results will be saved in particular method inside runs folder</li>
</ul>
Processed .pt dataset containing [25000, 10000, 10831] [train, valid, test] samples in order can be downloaded from <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/18X_UcsKrNowbbjg9osQsIq_XSLrfPb_m/view?usp=sharing">this link</a>. Initial 5000 labeled samples among 25000 training samples are present in <i>init_set.npy</i> file.

## Command:

 ```
    chmod +x run.sh
    ./run.sh
```

# Extras
<ul>
    <li>For GPU implementation of QP solver use <i><b>compute_uncertainty_diversity_gpu</b></i> function in selection_methods.py file</li>
